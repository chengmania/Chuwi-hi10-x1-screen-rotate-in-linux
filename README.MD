Stay in landscape when upright

Flip properly to portrait (top up)

Never show upside-down unless you actually rotate the device that way

Test it out and let me know how it feels! 


Set it up to autostart
Create autostart entry:
nano ~/.config/autostart/tablet-rotate.desktop

make the program executable 
chmod +x ~/tablet-rotate.py
