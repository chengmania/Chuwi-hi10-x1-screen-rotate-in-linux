Stay in landscape when upright

Flip properly to portrait (top up)

Never show upside-down unless you actually rotate the device that way

Test it out and let me know how it feels! If this finally locks in, I can help:

Add a smooth transition

Limit to only 2 orientations (landscape + portrait) if needed

Set it up to autostart

make the program executable 
chmod +x ~/tablet-rotate.py
